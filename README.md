so currently there is an error while trying to upload files, filename missing.
i think i need to restructure the code so when creating a folder, it creates a folder in the uploads folder, so i can link to that folder when creating a single file, or something like that.
also i need to check the routing logic and views, because most likely it is not routed and displayed correctly.
